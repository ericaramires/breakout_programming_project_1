## 📋 About This Refactor

### Original Project Context
Originally developed as a Programming I course assignment in Electronic Engineering (2015), the game was implemented as a single-file monolithic application using Allegro 5. While functional, it lacked the architectural sophistication expected in professional software development.

### Refactoring Objectives
This enhanced version demonstrates:
- **Professional Software Architecture**: Modular design principles
- **Industry Best Practices**: Clean code, proper separation of concerns
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Modern Development Standards**: Build systems, documentation, version control
